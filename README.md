# ScriptHookV-toggle

This program disables ScriptHookV (ScriptHookV.dll) and the ASI loader included with ScriptHookV (dinput8.dll) allowing you to play GTA Online without having to copy the files in and out of the GTA folder

Just input the directory were GTA was installed and it automaticaly detects if ScriptHookV is enabled or disabled and allows you to toggle it's state.

Further updates will add more functionality to the program...
